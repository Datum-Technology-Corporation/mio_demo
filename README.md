## About
|  | Executive Summary |
|-|-|
| [![Moore.io Logo](https://www.mooreio.com/content/images/logo.png)](https://www.mooreio.com/) | The [Moore.io](https://www.mooreio.com/) Demo project demonstrates the power of the Moore.io [CLI](https://mooreio-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html) and [UVM Template System](https://mooreio-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_templates.html).  Both are described thoroughly in the [Moore.io CLI User Manual](https://mooreio-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  This demo series is broken into several chapters: this branch (`ch1_start`) contains only the sample Design and Test Bench code.  The branch `ch1_end`(https://github.com/Datum-Technology-Corporation/mio_demo/tree/ch1_end) contains the 'solution' for those playing along.  The [video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSqqT6JtmecBIoC_3DMLk0g) for this chapter is available on [Datum's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSqqT6JtmecBIoC_3DMLk0g).

The entire demo video series is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSqqT6JtmecBIoC_3DMLk0g).
