## About
|  | Executive Summary |
|-|-|
| [![Moore.io Logo](https://www.mooreio.com/content/images/logo.png)](https://www.mooreio.com/) | The [Moore.io](https://www.mooreio.com/) Demo project demonstrates the power of the [Moore.io CLI](https://mio-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html) and [UVMx Template System](https://mio-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_templates.html).  Both are described thoroughly in the [Moore.io CLI User Manual](https://mio-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  This demo is broken into several Parts.  This branch (`main`) contains all code for all Parts.  The entire video series is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSqqT6JtmecBIoC_3DMLk0g).

For those who want to play along, it is best to fork this repository and start at the designated branches for each Part.

## Section 1 - Setup
### [Part 1 - Hello, UVM World!](https://github.com/Datum-Technology-Corporation/mio_demo/tree/p1_start)
The first Part deals with setting up a workstation for `mio` and [Xilinx® Vivado™ ML Edition](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools.html), importing existing Design and Test Bench code and running a simulation in Vivado.


## Section 2 - Spreadsheet to Simulation
### [Part 2 - Generating a block UVM test bench from Excel](https://github.com/Datum-Technology-Corporation/mio_demo/tree/p2_start)
A 3x3 Matrix APU Block is the subject of a Block-level UVM Test Bench in this chapter.  This makes use of Datum's [UVMx block code template generator](https://mio-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_templates.html#block-test-bench) and associated Libraries.

### Part 3 - Generating a UVM agent from Excel
**Coming soon**

### Part 4 - Generating a UVM register model from Excel
**Coming soon**

### Part 5 - Generating a sub-system UVM test bench from Excel
**Coming soon**

### Part 6 - Generating an FPGA UVM test bench from Excel
