|-|-|
| [![Moore.io Logo](https://www.mooreio.com/content/images/logo.png)](https://www.mooreio.com/) | The [Moore.io](https://www.mooreio.com/) Demo project demonstrates the power of the Moore.io [CLI](https://mooreio-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html) and [UVM Template System](https://mooreio-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_templates.html).  Both are described thoroughly in the [Moore.io CLI User Manual](https://mooreio-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  This demo is broken into several chapters.  This branch (`main`) contains all code for all chapters.  The entire video series is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSqqT6JtmecBIoC_3DMLk0g).


## [Chapter 1 - Workstation Setup](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSqqT6JtmecBIoC_3DMLk0g)
The first chapter deals with setting up a workstation for UVM simulation using `mio` and [Xilinx® Vivado™ ML Edition](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools.html), importing existing Design and Test Bench code and running a UVM Simulation in Vivado.
