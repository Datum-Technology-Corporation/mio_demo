| [![Moore.io Logo](https://www.mooreio.com/content/images/logo.png)](https://www.mooreio.com/) | The [Moore.io](https://www.mooreio.com/) Demo project demonstrates the power of the [Moore.io CLI](https://mio-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html) and [UVMx Template System](https://mio-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_templates.html).  Both are described thoroughly in the [Moore.io CLI User Manual](https://mio-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  This demo series is broken into several Parts: this branch (`p2_end`) contains the 'solution' to the instructions found in [`p2_start`](https://github.com/Datum-Technology-Corporation/mio_demo/tree/p2_start) for those playing along.  The [video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSqqT6JtmecBIoC_3DMLk0g) for this Part is available on [Datum's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSqqT6JtmecBIoC_3DMLk0g).
